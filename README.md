# SLOPE NZ 
### Accomodation Finder by Ciaran Slow

An accomodation finder for finding accomodation near NZ Ski Fields.

The project is a Summative Web Dev project for Yoobee Colleges Wellington.

This project uses HTML, CSS and JS. It makes uses of multiple JS Plugins & Libraries.



## PROBLEM:

Due to COVID-19 tourism to Queenstown and Wanka has significantly reduced, impacting local business operators majorly. Both of these regions rely heavily on tourism as their primary industries.  

To try to minimize the ongoing impact Tourism NZ has decided to launch a campaign targeting the upcoming ski season as a way to attract more business for the region from both local and international tourists. 


## SOLUTION:

Development of a showcase website that allows users useful booking information for the upcoming ski season. The site will include detailed interactive maps to help with locating accommodation, ski fields and nearby bars which meet the Qualmark standard. The site will make effective use of both Tourism NZ and Qualmark branding or imagery to showcase the ski fields/accommodation of the region.

The accommodation finder will allow user to search for accommodation based on:
Ski field selection - show results close by
Number of Guests 
Number of Nights
